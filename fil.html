<p>&quot;We love films and storytelling as a people. it's just a human compulsion to listen to and tell stories&quot;-Mychael Danna</p>
<p><br />
  Films allow you to tell stories from your perspective. Everything about making a film distracts you from that first rapturous vision you have of the film and </p>
<p>that’s why you need to get creative when the going gets tough! Just remember, the cameras is your canvas and the world is your medium!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The topics for film making are:</strong><br />
  •	Music Video; Acoustic Music (Junior Category)  - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMSZJULx9JE&feature=youtu.be">[[Example]]</a><br />
•	Trailer Making: Humour(Senior Category) </p>

<b>Explanation for Junior Category:</b> Acoustic music can be downloaded from the internet and used for the music video (footage has to be original and not copied). Delegates are not expected to make their own acoustic music for the videos.
