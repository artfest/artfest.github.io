<p>“Photography to me is catching a moment which is passing, and which is true.”-Jacques-Henr Lartigue</p>
<p><br />
  All photographs are memento mori. To take a photograph is to participate in another person’s mortality, vulnerability and mutability. </p>
<p>By slicing out this moment and freezing it, all photographs testify to time’s relentless melt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The topics for Photography First Rounds are:</strong><br />
  •	Silver Lining; Landscapes (Junior Category)<br />
•	Burn the Midnight Oil; night photography (Senior Category)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rules:</strong><br />
  • 	Each delegation may send in two teams, one for the Senior Category and<br />
  one for the Junior Category. <br />
  • 	There can be a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 5 members in each team. <br />
  •	There will be 2 rounds of the photography competition. <br />
  •	In round 1 each team will be provided with a board of 4 feet x 4 feet on<br />
  which the display of photographs can be designed to display<br />
  • 	The top 5 teams from both categories will continue to the second round in 		which contestants will be required to take photographs on campus in<br />
  allotted areas. <br />
  • 	Teams will have to submit their photographs in USBs before the end of the 		second day. The printing will be taken care of by the Art Fest team for which<br />
  contestants will be charged.<br />
  • 	They will then decorate a board with these photographs and the winner will 		be decided on the basis of these displays. <br />
  • 	Each team will have to display 5-10 photographs. <br />
  • 	The photographs must be related to the topic given and must not be less<br />
  than A4 size. <br />
  • 	Photographs must be completely unedited (i.e. Photoshop, etc). Also,<br />
  plagiarism will lead to disqualification.<br />
  • 	The participants must bring all of the equipment and materials they require 		for the presentation (i.e. laptops, USBs, UHU glue, double tape, accessories 		for decoration). They will be allotted 21/2 hours for each presentation.<br />
• 	Only glue and tape are to be used to stick the pictures on the board.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Photographs will be judged on the basis of:<br />
  1)	Content<br />
  2)	Originality<br />
  3)	Quality of the Images<br />
  4)	Use of Light<br />
5)	Display on the Boards</p>
<p><br />
