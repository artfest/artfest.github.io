<p>“It's amazing that the amount of news that happens in the world every day </p>
<p>always just exactly fits the newspaper.&quot; - Jerry Seinfeld </p>
<p><br />
  The art of journalism and information is one of the most underrated and misunderstood forms of art. For once, your artwork is </p>
<p>judged on what you did and did not include rather than just on what you did.<br />
  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The story for the news break will be given to the contestants on the first day of            the event.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong><br />
  • 	Each delegation may send in one team of minimum 3 or maximum 7 members. 	•	The news break can be a minimum of 1 and a half minutes and a maximum of <br />
  5 minutes <br />
  • 	Contestants will be given a news story/article with all details included and are <br />
  required to make a news segment or &quot;exposé&quot; deciding how to &quot;break&quot; the story <br />
  on their imaginary news channel. <br />
  • 	Contestants can use any person already present at the event for any acting or <br />
  visualising of the characters involved in the exposé. <br />
  • 	All footage must be original and should not have been used in any other <br />
  competition. Any video which does not abide by this rule, will be<br />
  DISQUALIFIED. <br />
  • 	Portrayal of high degrees of violence, profanity and any other offensive material 		is not allowed. <br />
  • 	The videos must be submitted in AVI format. If this is not possible, only WMV or <br />
  MP4 is acceptable. <br />
  • 	Videos must be submitted an hour before the screening starts to the category <br />
  head, details of which will be given on the day of the event. <br />
• 	All transitions or graphics used must be original.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The video will be judged on the basis of:<br />
  • Originality <br />
  • Story <br />
  • Cinematography <br />
• Editing</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Points</strong><br />
  1st  = 6<br />
  2nd = 4<br />
3rd  = 3</p>
