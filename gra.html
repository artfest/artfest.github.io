<p>“A work of art is above all an adventure of the mind.”-Eugene Ionesco<br />
  What are the principles for a good design to be effective? These are questions that many designers are seeking answers for. </p>
<p>If you think you have what it takes then come down to the Art &amp; Performing Arts Fest and show the designers what they really need to see. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The topic of Digital Art is:</strong></p>
<p>•	A Music Festival<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Rules:</strong><br />
  •	Each delegation may send in a maximum of two participants.<br />
  •	Participants will be provided with the name and theme (traditional, jazz etc.) of <br />
  the music festival at the start of the competition.<br />
  •	The time for the Digital Art Competition is 6 hours, with an hour’s break in between.<br />
  •	Participants may use any graphic designing software however the <br />
  Art Fest Management suggests the use of Adobe Photoshop.<br />
  •	Use of any sort of pre-designed template will lead to disqualification.<br />
  •	Use of hardware such as drawing pads e.g. Bamboo Pads, iPads or tablets<br />
  is permissible.<br />
  •	Delegates will be given access to the Internet. They may use<br />
  references, small vector images and/or use images taken by their delegation <br />
  in the Photography competition.<br />
  •	Participants will be required to produce a logo for the event alongside a promotional <br />
  poster (11” x 16”).<br />
  • 	Teams will have to submit their artwork in USBs by the end of  the allotted time. <br />
  Printing will be taken care of by the Art Fest team, for which contestants will be <br />
charged.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The submissions will be judged on the following criteria:<br />
  1)	Relevance of the artwork to the given themes and topics.<br />
  2)	Skills shown in the artwork related to digital art and <br />
graphic designing.<br />
  3)	Innovation and <br />
Creativity.</p>
